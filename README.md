## How to Play

* When the game is run, the player will be prompted to choose the size of the grid. For example, a 5x5 grid or a 10x10 grid.
* After the grid is displayed, the player will be asked to make a guess as to where they think the computers ship is located.
The players guess should be entered as two numbers seperated by a comma, representing the row and column, for example: (2,3)
* If the guess is correct, the player will be congratulated, and the game will end.
* If the player misses, the grid will be updated with and X at location of your guess to show you missed.
* The player has limited number of attempts to guess the ships location. If the player runs out of of attempts without hitting the ship, the game ends. After that, the location of the ship will be revealed.
* The game ends when the player hits the ship or runs out attempts. Once the player hits the ship, the player will be shown how many attempts it took to hit the ship.


## Features

* (Customizable Grid Size) The player can choose the grid size to adjust the difficulty of the game.
* (Random Ship Placement) The computer randomly place its ship on the grid at the start of each game.
* (User Friendly Interface) The game presents a simple grid where the player can track their guesses. Misses are marked with an X so the player can see their progress.
* (Limited Number of Attempts) The player has limited number of attempts adding and element of challenge.
* (Clear Instructions) The game provides clear feedback on weather your guess was a hit or a miss and prompts you to try again if your guess is off the grid or invalid.

### Features left to implement

* Due to time constraints, in the future I would like to add these further features.
* (Multiple Ships) Add the ability of the computer to place multiple ships on the grid, adding complexity.
* (Tracking Hits and Misses) Provide feedback on the number of hits and misses, show the the grid with missed and hit locations.
* (Score System) Keep track of the players score based on their performance.
* (Replay Feature) Add a feature to allow the player to replay the game after finishing, with either the same grid size or a new one. Add a prompt to ask if the player wants to play again.
